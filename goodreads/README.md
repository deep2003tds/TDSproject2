# README.md for Book Ratings Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This README document provides a detailed analysis of a dataset containing information about books, including ratings, authorship, and publication details. The dataset comprises 10,000 entries, with various features that describe book characteristics, ratings distribution, and clustering results.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following key features:
- `book_id`: Unique identifier for each book.
- `goodreads_book_id`: Goodreads ID for the book.
- `best_book_id`: Best book ID as per some ranking system.
- `work_id`: Unique work identifier.
- `books_count`: The number of books published by the author.
- `authors`: Author(s) of the book.
- `original_publication_year`: Year the book was first published.
- `average_rating`: The average rating of the book on Goodreads.
- `ratings_count`: Total number of ratings received by the book.
- `work_ratings_count`: Total number of ratings for the work.
- `ratings_1` to `ratings_5`: Counts of individual ratings from 1 to 5 stars.

## Summary Statistics
The summary statistics provide insights into the distribution of numerical features within the dataset. Key points include:

- The average rating across entries is around 3.76.
- The `ratings_count` shows a high variability, with a maximum of 436,802 ratings for a single title.
- There are 9,397 out of 10,000 complete entries for the `Cluster` feature, highlighting some clustering analysis was performed.
  
### Descriptive Statistics Overview
```
| Statistic     | book_id               | ratings_count   | average_rating | ...   | Cluster |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|-------|---------|
| Count         | 10,000               | 10,000           | 10,000         | ...   | 9,397   |
| Mean          | 5000.50              | 11,975.89        | 3.76           | ...   | 0.38    |
| Std. Dev.     | 2886.90              | 28,546.45        | 0.99           | ...   | 0.74    |
| Min           | 1                    | 323              | 1.00           | ...   | 0.00    |
| Max           | 10,000               | 793,319          | 5.00           | ...   | 3.00    |
```

## Missing Values
The dataset contains missing values in several columns:
- `isbn`: 700 missing entries
- `isbn13`: 585 missing entries
- `original_publication_year`: 21 missing entries
- `original_title`: 585 missing entries
- `language_code`: 1084 missing entries

Addressing these missing values may be crucial for any further analysis and might include strategies such as imputation or removal depending on the context of use.

## Visualizations
To enhance the analysis, two key visualizations have been produced:

1. **Correlation Heatmap**:  
   This heatmap shows the correlation between various features in the dataset. It helps in identifying relationships and multicollinearity among features.

2. **KMeans Clustering**:  
   A clustering algorithm was applied to the dataset, grouping books into clusters. The clustered data can be accessed [here](./clustered_data.csv).

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Exploration: Initial investigation of the dataset's structure, including summary statistics and missing values.
2. Visualization: Generate visualizations to explore correlations and clustering patterns.
3. Clustering: Utilize K-means clustering to group similar books based on ratings and other features.
4. Findings Review: Summarize insights derived from the data and visualizations.

## Key Findings
- The average ratings and ratings count highlight the popularity of certain books, which could be influential in future recommendations.
- The existence of clusters suggests that books can be categorized based on their ratings, potentially offering insights into reader preferences.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides foundational insights into the ratings and characteristics of books within the dataset. The findings and visualizations may guide further explorations, such as identifying trending genres or determining factors that lead to higher ratings.
