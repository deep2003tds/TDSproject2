### Missing Values
The dataset contains several columns with missing values. Here is a summary of the missing values per column:

- `Log GDP per capita`: 28 missing values
- `Social support`: 13 missing values
- `Healthy life expectancy at birth`: 63 missing values
- `Freedom to make life choices`: 36 missing values
- `Generosity`: 81 missing values
- `Perceptions of corruption`: 125 missing values
- `Positive affect`: 24 missing values
- `Negative affect`: 16 missing values

### Visualizations
Two key visualizations were generated from the dataset:

1. **Correlation Heatmap**
   - A heatmap showcasing the correlation between different attributes within the dataset was created. You can view and download the heatmap [here](./correlation_heatmap.png).

2. **KMeans Clustering**
   - KMeans clustering analysis was performed on the data, segmenting it into distinct clusters based on various attributes. The clustered data has been saved for further analysis and can be downloaded [here](./clustered_data.csv).

### Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: The first step involved identifying and handling missing values. Columns with a high number of missing values may need especial attention regarding imputation or exclusion during the analysis process.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and visualizations were generated to gain insights into the distributions of the various indicators across the countries. 

3. **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation heatmap was generated to understand the relationships between different indicators and how they potentially influence life satisfaction indicators.

4. **Clustering Analysis**: KMeans clustering was applied to categorize the countries based on similarities in well-being indicators and to reveal underlying patterns in the data.

### Key Findings
- The average **Life Ladder** score is approximately **5.48**, indicating a moderate level of reported life satisfaction across the dataset.
- There are significant correlations between indicators such as **Log GDP per capita**, **Social support**, and **Perceptions of corruption** with the **Life Ladder** score.
- The clustering analysis may reveal distinct groupings of countries based on their well-being characteristics, which can aid in targeted policy-making for enhancing life satisfaction.
